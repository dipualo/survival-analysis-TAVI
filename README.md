# Web App for Predicting Survival after TAVI

This project is based on a final degree project (TFG) in Computer Science at the University of Valladolid.

## 📝 Project Summary

This project focuses on predicting the **one-year survival probability** of patients who have undergone **Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation (TAVI)**. Using a dataset of **907 patients from the Hospital Clínico Universitario de Valladolid**, we developed a **Cox proportional hazards model** to estimate individual survival risks after the procedure.

The final product is an interactive **web application** that allows clinicians and researchers to input patient characteristics and obtain **personalised survival predictions** for decision-making support.
